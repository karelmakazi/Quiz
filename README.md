# Bamboozle

A quiz app that uses an expternal API to get quiz questions and then presents it to the user in a dynamically formatted style. In its current form it is limited to a single player only but I intend on expanding it to allow for multiple players through the rentention of names and high scores.

# Instructions
Prior to starting run: npm install 
Starting the game: npm run dev

# Planned expansions
- Currently experiencing API service issues, consider switching APIs to something a little more reliable. 
- Allow the saving and displaying of highscores for each category along with the user name.
- Write a comprehensive test suite.
- Apply strict CSS that can be manipulated by component data
